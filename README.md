# DSA Group Assignment â€“ Search and Sort Algorithms

This project is part of the group assignment for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (ITS60504). It demonstrates the implementation and performance analysis of common search and sort algorithms in **C++**.

# Features Implemented

This C++ console application performs the following:

# Sorting Algorithms
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

# Searching Algorithms
- Binary Search
- Exponential Search

# Performance Analysis
- Measures execution time (in milliseconds or microseconds) using `<chrono>`
- Allows users to:
  - Input number of elements (n)
  - Generate random numbers
  - Sort the data
  - Search for a specific number
